Three questions, 20 points. A few sentences each. Where a question asks for a
number, show where it came from.

## Question 1: The tail pointer (7 points)

Your `LinkedQueue` keeps a `tail` reference. Suppose you deleted it and found
the back of the queue by starting at `head` and following `next` until you ran
out of nodes.

What would `enqueue` cost then, in Big-O? The game calls `enqueue` once per
tick and runs about 7 ticks a second. For a snake 500 cells long, roughly how
many nodes would `enqueue` alone visit each second, and would you notice?

Now do the same for the autograder's speed test. It fills a queue with
400,000 items, then does 400,000 more rounds of dequeue-then-enqueue, so the
queue stays at 400,000. Roughly how many nodes would those enqueues visit?

```

```

## Question 2: The one method allowed to walk (7 points)

`contains` is O(n), and the game calls it through `snake.occupies(...)`. Read
`GameState.tick()` and `GameState.freeCell()` and find every call.

On a tick where the snake eats an apple, roughly how many nodes do those
`contains` calls visit in total, for a snake of length n on the 30 by 30
board? Give an expression in n. Then name a data structure from later in this
course that would make "is the snake on this cell?" fast, and say what it
would cost to keep it up to date as the snake moves.

```

```

## Question 3: Which end is the head? (6 points)

The snake's head is the **back** of the queue, and its tail end is the
**front**. Explain why, using what happens to the body on each tick.

Then suppose you flipped it, so the head was the front. Which operation would
each tick need that `LinkedQueue` does not have, and why is that operation hard
to make O(1) on a singly linked list?

```
